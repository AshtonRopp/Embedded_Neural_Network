## Introduction

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accelerator in System Verilog. View the [PowerPoint](FinalPresentation.pdf) for a quick summary. See the [OpenROAD](#openroad-results) and [Vivado](#vivado-fpga-results) results sections for a full analysis.

## Simulation Verification
This system is a simple neural network which prevents if an image is all black or all white. As such, the testbench consists of repeated injections of both classes. Shown below are the ModelSim waveforms and simulation outputs confirming that error is minimized after ~20 epochs. Note that the absolute value of the error decreases until this point in the waveform.

## OpenROAD Results
![Table of Results](Images/OpenROAD_Results.png)
The above figure contains PPA and timing results from OpenROAD. Key findings are summarized below.
- The timing column refers to the total time to process the testbench (40 inputs)
- TNS and WNS are improved for the final design, but timing is not closed
- Power saw a slight increase, while area saw a very large increase
- However, performance saw the biggest gains by far, improving to 5 times faster
- The power estimate is unreasonable, which is why I also tested using Vivado

To get some more reasonable power usage results, we can instead implement the system on an FPGA. We can then use these results to determine if the parallel processing used by the optimized version is worthwhile in terms of PPA.

- Vivado produces much more reasonable power estimates
- We see 1.42 times higher power usage by the optimized version
- The unoptimized version uses more LUT, but less DSP.
- From these results, the 5 times speed factor still dominates power and area increases
- The images below show the implemented logic on an FPGA

## Future Optimizations

- Resolve timing issues using OpenROAD flow scripts
- Implement clock gating and resource reuse for further PPA gains
- Improved architecture for lower power usage
- Further utilize OpenROAD timing, clock tree, and layout features
